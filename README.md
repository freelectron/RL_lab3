# Reinforcement Learning: Reproducibility Lab

_There are different types of experience replay, e.g. prioritised experience
replay and hindsight experience replay. Compare two or more types of
experience replay. Does the 'winner' depend on the type of environment?_

The plan is to compare the performance of normal experience replay,
prioritized experience replay (PER), and hindsight experience replay (HER)
using the DQN algorithm. Additionally, we want to test a new buffer
that we call the prioritized hindsight experience replay (PHER).
We test all of these on environments of increasing complexity.
